NOTE: This repository contains the guide documentation source. To view the guide in published form,
view it on the https://openliberty.io/guides/{projectid}.html[Open Liberty website].

//--** Start the introduction with "You'll explore how to..." or something similarly catchy.
//--** Write no more than two sentences, with meaningful information on what the user can accomplish
//--** with this guide.
//--** Do not start the introduction with "This guide...".
//--** EXAMPLE: Learn how to create a todo list API as a REST service using JAX-RS, CDI, and Open Liberty.




== What you'll learn

//--** Write about what the user will learn in a meaningful intro paragraph.
//--** Follow the intro paragraph with more details of what the user will learn, but still keep it brief.
//--** See the REST guide at as an exemplar guide.
//--** https://openliberty.io/guides/rest-intro.html
//--** https://github.com/OpenLiberty/guide-rest-intro

// EXAMPLE:
// =============================================================================
You'll learn how to create a todo list microservice using JAX-RS, CDI and Open Liberty.
You will use Maven throughout the guide to build the microservice and deploy it
to run on the Open Liberty application server.

=== What is JAX-RS
* Add a brief description of JAX-RS

=== What is CDI
* Add a brief description of CDI

=== What is Open Liberty
* Add brief description of Open Liberty, where applicable

Brief description of the todo list micrioservice

// If you have an image you want to include in the guide, store the image in the `assets` 
// folder in your repo, and add the following syntax
image::image-name.png[Image Caption,width=100%]


///////////////////////////
// Getting started
///////////////////////////

//--** Add this getting started section to your guide if it is applicable.
//--** Use the following include to pull in the git clone instructions from the guides-common repo.

[role='command']
include::{common-includes}/gitclone.adoc[]
//--** This include adoc will have the heading "Getting started".
//--** If you are not using this command include statement, you'll need to add it as a subheading,
//--** ie, "== Getting started".




///////////////////////////
// Try what youâ€™ll build
///////////////////////////

//--** This is a subsection of the "Getting started" section above. It should briefly walk the user
//--** through how to setup everything in the "finish" directory and try out the finished version of
//--** what they will be building.

[role='command']
include::{common-includes}/trywhatyoubuild-intro.adoc[]
//--** This include adoc will have the subheading "Try what you'll build".
//--** If you are not using this command include statement, you'll need to add it as a subheading,
//--** ie, "=== Try what you'll build".

//--** Describe what user should run and expect to see after running the complete version of the application.
Add a brief explanation on how to use the finished application.

[role='command']
include::{common-includes}/trywhatyoubuild-end.adoc[]




== Section title for this section, starting with a gerund like Creating, Building, etc

//--** Add the various sections that are needed for a particular guide.

//--** Start each additional section title with a meaningful gerund such as Creating, Building, Testing.
//--** Follow the gerund with a meaningful noun phrase. For example: Creating a JAX-RS application
//--** Have as many sections and section titles as needed.
// EXAMPLES:

* Building a todo list model

* Creating an application manager

* Creating the JAX-RS Resource


//--** Write a sentence with the context like "Navigate to the `start` directory to begin." in the section
//--** where user starts working with the implementation.


//--** What to add for each section:
//--** Start each section with a meaningful description about what the user is doing in the section.
//--** Include code snippets.
//--** Avoid making all the documentation a series of steps and tasks, bullets, or numbered lists.
//--** Use tick marks around directories, files, values, class names, method names, and so on.
//--** Example: `this-is-a-file`, `this/is/a/path`, `thisIsAMethod`.



// EXAMPLE: The following block demonstrates how different sections look like for a todo application.
// ======================================================================================================
== EXAMPLE: Building a todo list model

* Navigate to the `start` directory
* Represent an entry in a todo list

[role="code_command hotspot", subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the `TodoModel` class.#
`src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/todolistSample/models/TodoModel.java`
----

TodoModel.java
[source, Java, linenums, indent=0, role="code_column"]
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/todolistSample/models/TodoModel.java[tags=**;!copyright;]
----

* Getters, setters, and default constructor such that the model can be serialized/deserialized easily

== EXAMPLE: Creating an application manager

* Create a manager that is injected into the JAX-RS resource

[role="code_command hotspot file=0", subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the `TodoManager` interface.#
`src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/todo/managers/TodoManager.java`
----

TodoManager.java
[source, Java, linenums, indent=0, role="code_column"]
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/todolistSample/managers/TodoManager.java[tags=**;!copyright;]
----

* Next, create the sample todo manager class

[role="code_command hotspot file=1", subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the `SampleTodoManager` class.#
`src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/todolistSample/managers/samples/SampleTodoManager.java`
----

SampleTodoManager.java
[source, Java, linenums, indent=0, role="code_column"]
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/todolistSample/managers/samples/SampleTodoManager.java[tags=**;!copyright;]
----

* Implemented basic CRUD ([hotspot=32-36 file=1]`Create`, [hotspot=39-44 file=1]`Read`,
[hotspot=47-57 file=1]`Update`, and [hotspot=60-68 file=1]`Delete`) operations.
* Manager is [hotspot=14 file=1]`ApplicationScoped`, which essentially means that it is a singleton.

== EXAMPLE: Creating the JAX-RS resource

* Description of the technology, possibly with a link to learn more.
* Use CDI to inject the todo manager into the resource

[role="code_command hotspot", subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the `TodoResource` class.#
`src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/todolistSample/resources/TodoResource.java`
----

TodoResource.java
[source, Java, linenums, indent=0, role="code_column"]
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/todolistSample/resources/TodoResource.java[tags=**;!copyright;]
----

* The resource methods are accessible via HTTP
* Use [hotspot=27-43]`GET`, [hotspot=45-54]`POST`, [hotspot=56-71]`PUT`,
and [hotspot=73-83]`DELETE` verbs to handle reading, creating, updating,
and deleting resources
* Validate data models and send appropriate response accordingly

//--** This include adoc will have the subheading "Building and running the application".
//--** If you are not using this command include statement, you'll need to add it as a subheading,
//--** ie, "== Building and running the application".

//--** In between here, you should state where you application can be found now that its running. ie. urls
//--** Sample usage of the application
//--** Suggestions for what changes the reader can make to explore the code

//--** OPTIONAL: after listing the test results, mention a simple change a user can make/introduce that
//--** will cause the tests to fail. Be brief and don't give the users all of the instructions.
//--** At this point, they should be comfortable enough to figure it out on their own.




== Great work! You're done!
